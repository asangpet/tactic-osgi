/**
 * The Agent manages the data it represents by the QmfAgentData class - a derivative of the QmfData class.
 * <p>
 * The Agent is responsible for managing the values of the properties within the object, as well as servicing
 * the object's method calls. Unlike the Console, the Agent has full control of the state of the object.
 * <p>
 * In most cases, for efficiency, it is expected that Agents would <i>actually</i> manage objects that are subclasses of 
 * QmfAgentData and maintain subclass specific properties as primitives, only actually explicitly setting the
 * underlying Map properties via setValue() etc. when the object needs to be "serialised". This would most
 * obviously be done by extending the mapEncode() method (noting that it's important to call QmfAgentData's mapEncode()
 * first via super.mapEncode(); as this will set the state of the underlying QmfData).
 * <p>
 * This class provides a number of methods aren't in the QMF2 API per se, but they are used to manage the association
 * between a managed object and any subscriptions that might be interested in it.
 * <p>
 * The diagram below shows the relationship between the Subscription and QmfAgentData.
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/Subscriptions.png"/>
 * <p>
 * In particular the QmfAgentData maintains references to active subscriptions to allow agents to asynchronously
 * push data to subscribing Consoles immediately that data becomes available.
 * <p>
 * The update() method indicates that the object's state has changed and the publish() method <b>immediately</b> sends
 * the new state to any subscription.
 * <p>
 * The original intention was to "auto update" by calling these from the setValue() method. Upon reflection this
 * seems a bad idea, as in many cases there may be several properties that an Agent may wish to change which would
 * lead to unnecessary calls to currentTimeMillis(), but also as theSubscription update is run via a TimerTask it is
 * possible that an update indication could get sent part way through setting an object's overall state.
 * Similarly calling the publish() method directly from setValue() would force an update indication on partial changes
 * of state, which is generally not the desired behaviour.
