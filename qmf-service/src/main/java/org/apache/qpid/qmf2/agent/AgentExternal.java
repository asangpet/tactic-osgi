/**
 * The AgentExternal class must be used by those applications that implement the external store model described in 
 * <a href=https://cwiki.apache.org/qpid/qmfv2-api-proposal.html>QMF2 API Proposal</a>. 
 * <p>
 * The AgentExternal class extends the Agent class by adding interfaces that notify the application when it needs to
 * service a request for management operations from the agent.
 * <p>
 * N.B. The author is not convinced that there is any particular advantage of the AgentExternal model over the
 * basic Agent model and indeed the API forces some constructs that are actually likely to be less efficient, as an
 * example sending a separate queryResponse() for each object forces a look up of a List of QmfAgentData objects
 * keyed by the consoleHandle for each call. There is also the need to separately iterate through the List of
 * QmfAgentData objects thus created to create the mapEncoded list needed for sending via the QMF2 protocol.
 * There are similar inefficiencies imposed in the subscriptionIndicate() method that are not present in the
 * Subscription code implemented in the Agent class for the "Internal Store" Agent model.
 * <p>
 * To be honest the author only bothered to implement AgentExternal for completeness and is unlikely to use it himself.
