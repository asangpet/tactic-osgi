 * The <code>ParallelConvolutionRemote</code> class provides a Java RMI-compliant 
 * interface to the M-functions from the files:
 * <pre>
 *  D:\\workspace\\tactic\\matlab-service\\src\\main\\matlab\\deleteJob.m
 *  D:\\workspace\\tactic\\matlab-service\\src\\main\\matlab\\doConv.m
 *  D:\\workspace\\tactic\\matlab-service\\src\\main\\matlab\\doDeconv.m

 *  D:\\workspace\\tactic\\matlab-service\\src\\main\\matlab\\getJobStatus.m
 *  D:\\workspace\\tactic\\matlab-service\\src\\main\\matlab\\waitForJob.m
 * </pre>
 * The {@link #dispose} method <b>must</b> be called on a 
 * <code>ParallelConvolutionRemote</code> instance when it is no longer needed to ensure 
 * that native resources allocated by this class are properly freed, and the server-side 
 * proxy is unexported.  (Failure to call dispose may result in server-side threads not 
 * being properly shut down, which often appears as a hang.)  
 *
 * This interface is designed to be used together with 
 * <code>com.mathworks.toolbox.javabuilder.remoting.RemoteProxy</code> to automatically 
 * generate RMI server proxy objects for instances of 
 * one.matlab.tools.ParallelConvolution.
